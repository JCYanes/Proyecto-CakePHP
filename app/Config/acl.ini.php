; Use this file to specify user permissions.
; aco = access control object (something in your application)
; aro = access request object (something requesting access)
;
; User records are added as follows:
;
; [uid]
; groups = group1, group2, group3
; allow = aco1, aco2, aco3
; deny = aco4, aco5, aco6
;
; Group records are added in a similar manner:
;
; [gid]
; allow = aco1, aco2, aco3
; deny = aco4, aco5, aco6
;
; The allow, deny, and groups sections are all optional.
; NOTE: groups names *cannot* ever be the same as usernames!
;
; ACL permissions are checked in the following order:
; 1. Check for user denies (and DENY if specified)
; 2. Check for user allows (and ALLOW if specified)
; 3. Gather user's groups
; 4. Check group denies (and DENY if specified)
; 5. Check group allows (and ALLOW if specified)
; 6. If no aro, aco, or group information is found, DENY
